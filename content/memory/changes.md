rollback_hint: "Manually revert the added sha256 requirements in selfware.md 11.2 and the mirrored line in content/selfware_demo.md; remove the corresponding decision/change records if needed."
notes: "Trust metadata remains optional; verification uses sha256 as the minimal integrity anchor."

rollback_hint: "Manually remove the Self‑Analysis section from selfware.md and its mirror in content/selfware_demo.md; remove the linked decision/change records if needed."
